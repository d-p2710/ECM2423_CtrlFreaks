### Ideas:
- Gamification: league tables, houses (?) -> individual and group points system 
- Individuals have xp points (cumulative) and coins (to spend, related to xp points) 
- Houses: maybe related to faculties? 
- Individual users have an avatar, which can be upgraded by purchasing items from the shop using coins 
- General game layout: QR codes (ping notifications if within a radius of a location of interest) dotted around campus, with 3 objectives: 
- Info points: scan these to open a page of sustainability info & gain 1 point 
- Quiz points: scan these to open a quiz (related to the location?)  with regards to sustainability -> gain 3 points 
- Challenge: scan these to get insight to an ongoing challenge in that area -> gain 5 points upon completion? 
- Avatar: simplistic blob? Upgrades may include different facial expressions, thought bubbles, outfits, sponsored animals, backgrounds, decorative plants etc. 
- Potential seasonal events? Related to international earth day maybe?  
- Additional games: crosswords!
